# JS-04: JavaScript Operators and Loops

This project demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators, as well as loop constructs.

## Files

- [index.html](index.html): The main HTML file that loads the JavaScript code.
- [main.js](main.js): Contains commented examples and explanations of JavaScript operators and loops.
- [README.md](README.md): Project documentation.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)

### 2. Assignment Operators

- `=`
- `+=`
- `-=`
- `*=`
- `/=`

### 3. Comparison Operators

- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Strict equality (`===`)
- Not equal (`!==`)
- Loose equality (`==`)

### 4. Logical Operators

- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)
- NOT (`!`)

### 5. Loops

- `for` loop (with index)
- `for...of` loop (for arrays)

## How to Run

1. Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser.
2. Open the browser console to view the output from [main.js](main.js).
3. Uncomment code blocks in [main.js](main.js) to see different examples in action.

## Usage

This project is intended for learning and experimenting with basic JavaScript syntax and constructs. Modify and uncomment code in [main.js](main.js) to explore how different operators and loops work.
