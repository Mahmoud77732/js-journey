Intro to JavaScript with examples, notes, and hands-on coding practice.

## What is JavaScript?
* JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for client-side web development, but it can also run on servers.

## Server-side vs Client-side Languages
* **Server-side languages** run on the web server (e.g., Node.js, PHP, Python).
* **Client-side languages** run in the user's browser (e.g., JavaScript).

## What Can JS Do?
* Dynamically update content
* Manipulate HTML & CSS
* Animate images & content, create image galleries
* Manipulate & validate data
* Control multimedia (audio, video, etc.)
* Build web browser games
* Develop mobile apps

## Content Covered
* Core language features
* DOM (Document Object Model)
* BOM (Browser Object Model)
* OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
* ES6, ES7 features
* Practice exercises and examples

## Getting Started
* I experimented with writing JavaScript in different ways:
    * Using the `<script>` tag in HTML
    * Linking to external JS files
    * Writing inline scripts

## How to Run the Examples
1. Open the HTML files in your browser.
2. Check the console for output and experiment with the code.
3. Modify the JS files to try your own ideas.
